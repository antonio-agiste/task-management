# Notes
Some things to note:
- I didn't complete the unit testing part
- I used json-server (as recommended in the description) but there are some issues with querying which I was not able to solve so search is very strict

# How to run
1. Install using `pnpm install`
2. Open a terminal and start the json-server using `npx json-server database/db.json`
3. Run the application using `pnpm dev`
